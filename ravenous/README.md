Originally this web application was my 1st Codecademy Project.

Things that i have changed and added:
-------------------------------------
1. Changed the styling to my prefrence, resized elements, changed colors, pictures, and ect..

2. fetched new endpoints from the Yelp api. For example - catagories, Prices, and review number.

3. Created seperate component for the Rating endpoint to change the json Response from a string to star icons. Did the same for the prices endpoint.

4. If the prices were not retreived, return 'price unknown'.
